> A simple Breakout game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. This game features a player-controlled paddle, a bouncing ball, and breakable walls.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the game.
2. Control the paddle using the `a` (left) and `d` (right) keys.
3. Bounce the ball off the paddle to break the walls.
4. Score points by breaking the walls and avoiding the ball hitting the bottom wall.
5. The game ends when the ball hits the bottom wall three times.

## üèÖ Developed During Python Bootcamp

This Breakout game was developed as part of the 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp ([Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)), a comprehensive course designed to teach Python programming through hands-on projects. This project showcases the skills and concepts learned in the course, including object-oriented programming, graphics with the Turtle library, and game development.
